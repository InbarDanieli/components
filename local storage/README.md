# Local Storage
local storage is a grate and easy way to save data in the client side,
the basic properties you wanna know are:
### `setItem(key, value)`
this property will storage the item you gave it,
every item needs to have: injective (one-to-one) key to identifie the place in the storage and a value.

### `getItem(key)`
this property will get the item you choose (by writing the key of the value), 
with this you can get your value and use it as you like.

### `removeItem(key)`
this property will delete an item you choose (by writing the key of the value)

### `clear()`
this property is really doing what it called, it delete (or clear) all the items in the storage
